# Render Blueprint — deploy the MTGDoku API (Node + SQLite) as a Web Service.
# Use this when connecting the repo to Render: New → Blueprint → connect repo → Render will use this file.
#
# The frontend (index.html, daily.html, css, js) is meant to be hosted on GitHub Pages;
# this service only needs to serve the API. For a backend-only deploy you could later
# strip static file serving and only expose /api/board.
